LILAC is my research project on real-time motion stylization — basically turning an offline VAE–Diffusion motion model into a streaming, causal version that can handle long sequences with smooth transitions. If this project looks interesting, feel free to ⭐ it — once it gains enough attention, I’ll open-source the full code.
